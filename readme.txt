= Great Apps =

With SiteApps you can use hundreds of apps, see our [marketplace](http://siteapps.com/apps). 

= These are some kinds of apps available: =
* [Social Media Apps](http://siteapps.com/apps/social_media-26);
* [Design/CSS/UX](http://siteapps.com/apps/design_ux-25);
* Be professional with our [Google Analytics Improvements](http://siteapps.com/apps/google_analytics_enhancements-23). See more tips in our [forum](http://support.siteapps.com/forums/20401973-Google-Analytics-Optimization);

* E-commerce acelerator with [Paypal](http://siteapps.com/paypal) (Only in portuguese);

Installing an app is easy, and you have powerful features. 

= Segmentation/Behavioral Targeting =

You can use segmentation with SiteApps. By default, you have five segments configured in SiteApps: Social Media, Returning Visitor, New Visitor, Search (users coming from Google, Bing, etc.), Smartphone and Tablet. These user segments allow you to deliver different apps to your visitors.

You can use other segments, such as [GeoSegmentation and GeoTargeting](http://support.siteapps.com/entries/22356408-SiteApps-GeoSegmentation-and-GeoTargeting-Basics) and [Google Analytics Segmentation](http://support.siteapps.com/entries/20068541-google-analytics-segmentation-and-targeting). This way, you can have many params in your application: city, state, country, when (date + time control), where (url), how (frequency control), who (segments), and so on.

= Some usage examples include =
* Show ads widget to only search engine visitors.
* Show subscribe widget to only returning visitors.
* Show an "About me" widget to only new visitors. ... and the list goes on and on (let creativity be your guide!).

= Site Data Analysis =

You can see a explanation in [our blog](http://blog.siteapps.com/the-new-siteapps-is-here-combining-website-segmentation-and-app-marketplace-into-an-all-in-one-solution/) or SiteApps in [Google Analytics Blog](http://analytics.blogspot.com.br/2013/02/optimize-your-website-with-siteapps-and.html).
